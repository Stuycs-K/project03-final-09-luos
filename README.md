# Tic-Tac-Toe

### Inversion

Steven Luo

### Project Description:

This is a rudimentary implementation of tic-tac-toe, displayed via terminal.

Each player takes turns on the same computer, inputting the cell number they want to place a marker at.

The cell number is the following: \[Row number\]-\[Column Number\].

Ideally, the final project is [Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe), but due to time constraints, this may not be possible.

### Instructions:

How does the user install/compile/run the program.
How does the user interact with this program?
